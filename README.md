# Anomaly_Detection_Model
The dataset has records of producing a specifing item. The dataset contains two variables 'raw_material'. the amount of raw material used in the production 
process, and 'time', the amount of time taken for the production. I will use the Isolation forest model to remove anomalies in the data to improve the performance of the model.
